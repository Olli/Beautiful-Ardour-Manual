<p>
  An <dfn>automation curve</dfn> is a series of lines connected by <dfn>control
  points</dfn> that typically defines a continuous line. As the curve is
  traversed from left to right, the line defines the level of the parameter
  controlled by the automation lane.
</p>

<p>
  There are two types of automation curves: <kbd class=menu>Linear</kbd> and
  <kbd class=menu>Discrete</kbd>. The most common type is <kbd
  class=menu>Linear</kbd>, in which the space between any two contiguous
  control points is continuously interpolated; in other words, the values
  between any two contiguous control points at any given time is given by the
  straight line connecting them. The second type of automation curve is <kbd
  class=menu>Discrete</kbd>, in which no interpolation between control points
  is done; whatever value the control point is set at is the value it will
  yield until it reaches the next control point, at which point it will give
  that value until the next control point, and so on until there are no more
  control points.
</p>

<p class=note>
  The curve by itself does nothing; it will <em>only</em> control playback if
  the lane it resides in is in <kbd class=menu>Play</kbd> mode.
