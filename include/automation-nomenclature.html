<p>
  Track automation occurs in one or more <dfn>lanes</dfn>. Each lane has a
  control that allows setting the amount or position of a certain
  <dfn>parameter</dfn> associated with the lane. Parameters are things that can
  be controlled on a track's automation lane, such as volume, panning, muting,
  trim, etc. <dfn>Automation curves</dfn> typically consist of lines connected by
  <dfn>control points</dfn>, that live within the confines of a lane; these
  tell Ardour how to change a given parameter over time. <dfn>Automation
  modes</dfn> define how Ardour creates the values in between the control
  points of a given automation curve, either by connecting them with continuous
  lines or not. <dfn>Automation states</dfn> govern how a given automation lane
  will behave during playback.
